# Objective

## Relevance
The purpose of this project is to analyse popular music in Spotify and understand how music *hits* are trending over time. We also compare different music genres over a variety of music features, revealing trends.

## Problem to address

Spotify recognizes the importance of tweaking its reccomendation algorithm for each user, based on their previous preferences. This project aims to provide a clearer understanding on popular songs over the last decade by resourcing to different helpful visualizations. 

## Questions to answer
1.	How the music metrics change over time? 
2.	Can we identify a music genre by its metrics values? How do different genres differ?
3.	How is genre popularity changing over time?
4.	What features characterizes a hit song?
5.	Which words are getting more common in music lyrics? And by genre and artist? 

# Visualization

A dashboard containing 5 idioms: Heatmap, Line Chart, Radar Chart, Scatter Plot and Word Cloud.

Across the visualization the user can pick one or two genres out of seven categories - *Country*, *Edm*, *Pop*, *Rap*, *Rock*, *R&B* and *Unknown*. Each genre is color coded and that color is consistent across the visualization. The user is also allowed to pick one or two metrics where each metric represents a musical feature. All the visualizations adjust to exhibit the selected genres and metrics.
